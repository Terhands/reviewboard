Extending Templates
===================

Steps:
	1. Navigate to the directory of the template to extend (within reviewboard/templates)
	2. Create a new text file with a name in the format originalTemplate_extended.html
	3. Inside the extended template file add the tag
			{% extends "reviewboard/pathToTemplateFromTheTemplateDirectory/originalTemplate.html" %}
	4. If you open the orinalTemplate.html file you will see block tags in the form:
			{% block blockName %} throughout the file
	5. Add the {% block blockName %} tag that you want to change to the top of the extension file
			Note: You can extend as many blocks as you want from the original as long as it has
			a properly nested matching endblock tag
	6. Add a closing block tag at the end of the extension file {% endblock %}
	7. Add the {{block.super}} tag inside the block tags that have been added to the
			extension file (this adds all of the content from the originalTemplate to the
			extended block)
	8. Add any desired html inside the block tags (everything added before the {{block.super}}
			tags will appear before the original content, everything added after the {{block.super}}
			tags will appear after the original content)

Example - extending dashboard_manage.html

	1. dashboard_manage.html is in the directory reviewboard/templates/admin/dashboard
	2. Create dashboard_manage_extended.html in reviewboard/templates/admin/dashboard
	3. Open dashboard_manage_extended.html and add the following extension tag:
			{% extends "reviewboard/admin/dashboard.html" %} (note you do not need to include templates)
	4. Open the dashboard_manage.html file to get the appropriate block tag
			{% block manage %}
	5. Add {% block manage %} to the extension file (under the extends tag)
	6. Add the {% endblock %}	 tag to the end of the extension file
	7. Add {{block.super}} inside the block tags
	8. Add the desired html extension (Add the text "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>" after the
			{{block.super}} tag)

Save the extension file

When the admin/dashboard_manage.html template is next loaded the extension will load in its place
and the text Hello, World! will appear after the original content.
